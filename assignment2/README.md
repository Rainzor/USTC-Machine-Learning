## Machine Learning Lab2
## SVM

Written by Yanwu Gu & Modified by Yuanhao Pu 2023.11.11

### 1. Theory of Supported Vector Machine
Please refer to the ppt or the Chap 6 of the textbook.

### 2. Data
In order to simplify the lab, we give the function `generate_data(dim, num)` for you to freely generate the data. The data was linearly separable but some mistakes were intentional. Features, labels, and rate of mislabeling will be given by the function respectively.

You do not need to modify the function `generate_data(dim, num)`.

### 3. Tasks, Tips, and Requirements
#### 3.1 Tasks
You are required to complete the class SVM1 and SVM2 using different methods to find the solution of the supported vector machine. More specifically, since the key to solving SVM is to solve the quadratic programming problem (6.6) in your textbook, you just need to use two methods to solve (6.6). The remaining part like predict can be the same.

After finishing the SVM class, you need to test the efficiency of your code. The comparison must include

* The accuracy;
* The time of calculation (training);
* If possible, you can use `sklearn` to compare with your code, feel free to be beaten by it.

#### 3.2 Tips
Here are some tips for the lab:

We do not recommend you use existing library functions to solve the quadratic programming problem directly, which will be penalized. However, if you cannot complete two methods from scratch, you can still use them for comprehension.
We recommend you use proper dims to make sure your result is reliable, and different dims or numbers of examples will make your report rich in content. But do not let it be verbose.
Since our data is based on linear kernels, you do not need to try other kernels. But you can try soft margin or regularization to improve the ability of your model. Remember it's not the key point of this lab.
Remember to add your mislabel rate, which is generated by the function `generate_data`.

#### 3.3 Requirements
Do not use **sklearn** or other machine learning libraries in your manuscript, you are only permitted with **numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and Standard Library**, you are required to write this project from scratch.
You are allowed to discuss with other students, but you are not allowed to plagiarize the code, we will use an automatic system to determine the similarity of your programs, and once detected, both of you will get zero marks for this project.

### 4. Submission

Your report should include but not limited to the following contents:

* The method you use, and briefly talk about its principle
* The result of your methods
* The comparison of your methods
